Most commands that you'll send me will need to be sent to the #bot channel in the server but I can also process some commands via direct message.\r\n\r\nFirst things first you might want to set your team, there are three available teams: Valor, Mystic, and Instinct. To set your team you'll want to use the `.team Valor/Mystic/Instinct` command, although this is optional. For more details please read the pinned message in the #bot channel titled Team Assignment.\r\nNext you'll need to assign youself to some city feeds to see Pokemon spawns and Raids. Quickest way is to type the `.feedme all` command, otherwise please read the pinned message in the #bot channel titled City Feeds for more details.\r\nLastly if you'd like to get direct messages from me when a certain Pokemon with a specific IV percentage or raid appears, to do so please read the pinned message in the #bot channel titled Pokemon Notifications.\r\n\r\nI will only send you direct message notifications of Pokemon or raids for city feeds that you are assigned to.\r\n**To see a full list of my available commands please send me a direct message containing `.help`.**\r\n\r\nOnce you've completed the above steps you'll be all set to go catch those elusive monsters, be safe and have fun!",
